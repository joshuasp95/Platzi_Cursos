- So called career reviews amount to nothing, just ticking boxes on an outdated HR system. No opportunities to develop knowledge and gain skills. Happy to just let good staff members leave for better opportunities than invest in them.


 - Forcing employees back into the office for hybrid working, when majority would prefer and are more productive working from home. 


- Salaries are supposedly benchmarked for roles at the same level, when there's been plenty of instances where some individuals are earning much more than everyone else at their level. 


- Salaries way below industry standards. No pay reviews. - Some team managers have absolutely no experience on how to run a team. They also just ride on the knowledge of their junior team members.


 - Absolutely zero progression unless you're one of the lucky ones who gets promoted on the sly without the role being advertised to anyone else. 


- Technology is massively outdated for a company that claims to be at the home of it. 


- Internal employees consistently overlooked for promotions in favour of bringing in external applicants. 


- Lack of transparency about recent redundancies.
